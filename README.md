# Network-Analysis-Of-characters-of-novel-Les Miserables

## About Project:
This project contains an analysis of the weighted network of coappearances of characters in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Miserables".
Nodes represent characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of characters that appear in the same chapter of the book.
The values on the edges are the number of such coappearances. The data on coappearances were taken from D. E. Knuth,
The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).

Creating the network and analysing on the basis of Important entities from different points of view.
Communities existing within the network. Community characteristics for differentiation with other communities. 
Seeking insight on relationship of nodes within and outside communities.

Initially, when we loaded the file, we analysed a few things:

• The network comprises 74 characters, and they’re all connected by 254 links.

• Links are undirected, meaning that if A is connected to B, then it is the same as B connected to A.

• The report also tells us the graph is not dynamic: it means there is no evolution or chronology, it won’t “move in time”.

## Softwares:
Gephi Ms Word Adobe Acrobat Reader

## Pipeline of the Project:
Importing the dataset on gephi Processing the graphs for sensible and meaningful visuals Gaining insight from the graphs using gephi
visualization features i.e.,statistics, filters, graph layout etc. 
Obtaining the concluded graph based on queries Previewing the output graph Making report of the entire process with visuals
